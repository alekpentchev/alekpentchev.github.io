# Welcome to my GitHub page!
##_I am Aleksander Pentchev and few months ago I began my adventure in front-end web development..._

Currently I am looking for opportunities to work as a junior front-end developer. 
I am using:
- HTML5 
- CSS3
- JS
- RWD
- Bootstrap (basics)
- jQuery (basics)
- Sass (basics)
- Photoshop (basics) - .psd to html

In the nearest future I want to learn (besides mastering the previous mentioned languages/techniques) among others:
- Angular or React
- other
- basics of Python, mostly for data analysis

That is why the time has come to start publishing what I am currently doing to show my progress and commitment.
On this page I would like to list my latest projects in front-end web development.
Latest projects:

1. [Dark Souls Fansite](http://alekpentchev.github.io/dark-souls-fansite/mainPage.html) (04.2017) - final project developed for web development classes. Solutions used:
- HTML5 & CSS3
- XHTML 1.0 strict
- Bootstrap
- JavaScript

2. PSD to HTML template - Bluebox (05.2017) - currently in development, I will upload it in few days

If you have any questions, contact me via alek.pentchev@gmail.com
